# UserJoinLeaveNotifications

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/). Adds notifications to the notifications panel
when users join or leave your focused session or any session you're in. Clicking on the notification opens the user's profile page and can focus the relevant session as well.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [UserJoinLeaveNotifications.dll](https://github.com/badhaloninja/UserJoinLeaveNotifications/releases/latest/download/UserJoinLeaveNotifications.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
